Node.js application for Raspberry Pi to manage a garage door using multiple entry codes and availability times and days. Utilizes a 4x4 keypad for code entry, Twilio for sending SMS alerts and a one channel relay for activating a garage door (can easily be modified to control multiple relays and multiple doors). Also utilizes the Raspberry Pi GPIO library for node.js by Jonathan Perkin (https://github.com/jperkin/node-rpio).
